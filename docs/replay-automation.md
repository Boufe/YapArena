# Automatic adaptive replay packaging

This checkpoint replaces the manual packaging/publication prerequisite for eligible
recordings when automatic packaging is enabled in the dedicated encoder worker.
Caption review remains optional: an absent reviewed WebVTT file never blocks conversion
or replay publication. Existing approved captions accompany a package; a subsequent
approved caption change creates a new immutable package. This change adds no transcription
service and makes no claim about automatic caption generation or caption quality.

The earlier operator workflow in [decision 0004](decisions/0004-live-debate-replay.md)
describes the prototype. This subsequent decision authorizes automatic **ended → replay**
publication after a verified adaptive package. It changes neither live-end timestamps,
financial participation closure, finalization, outcomes, nor approval for financial activity.
Only published, non-demo events under a published topic, with ended media and a verified
nonempty recording for the expected Egress key, qualify. Hidden/draft/cancelled/live events
remain ineligible; no encoder result overrides an operator visibility change.

## Delivery choice

Continue recording the verified room-composite MP4, then transcode offline to 240p,
480p and 720p HLS with aligned two-second H.264/AAC segments. LiveKit documents simultaneous
file and segmented outputs, but its [Egress API](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/other/egress/api/)
allows one segmented output and one encoding configuration per request. Therefore a single
documented direct HLS Egress request does not produce this three-quality adaptive ladder.
Several differently encoded concurrent Egress jobs would introduce additional live
recording resources and failure coordination. Offline MP4 conversion reuses the existing
verified source and keeps that work outside the live path. This is an engineering inference
from the documented API; it does not claim LiveKit can never deliver adaptive HLS.
See [LiveKit output options](https://docs.livekit.io/transport/media/ingress-egress/egress/outputs/)
and [FFmpeg HLS muxing](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#hls-2).

The web service never starts FFmpeg. A separate worker requires Node 24, FFmpeg/ffprobe
with libx264/AAC, runtime PostgreSQL credentials, private bucket credentials, and an
available authenticated replay edge/signing configuration. It requires no database-owner
credential or Cloudflare deployment token. No worker or paid service is provisioned by
this checkpoint. Main process/configuration/CI wiring accompanies the integration commit.

## Queue and publication invariants

Migration `1791385198189_automatic-replay-packaging.js` creates private RLS-protected
`media_replay_jobs` and `media_replay_attempts`. Runtime privileges are explicit; public
and browser roles receive none. Input bindings are immutable to runtime UPDATE.
Jobs bind a room, verified source key and SHA-256 digest of the current optional reviewed
caption text (absent text uses the digest of an empty string). A pinned source ETag is
required, and download uses `If-Match`. SHA-256 records the downloaded source bytes too.

Bounded periodic reconciliation discovers eligible inputs, repairs expired leases and
invalidates obsolete work. Claims use database time and
[FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html), without
holding a transaction during download, conversion or upload. One current input has one
durable job; each of its at most five attempts has a fresh UUID token and package prefix.
Backoff has jitter and is capped at 60 seconds. Process loss returns the job after lease
expiry; no stale token can renew or publish it. An exhausted input remains failed, so
retention cannot silently reset its attempt budget. A new source, approved caption change,
or newer authorized republication may produce a new input/job.

Domain removal/visibility/source/caption changes invalidate jobs in the same transaction
via private triggers, including event deletion. Cleanup tombstones deliberately survive
parent deletion. Final completion acquires **topic → debate → media → community room →
job → attempt** locks. Domain writers acquire domain/community locks before queue locks;
ordinary queue claims acquire only queue locks. Multi-row invalidation takes jobs in UUID
order. Completion rechecks source/caption bindings, visibility, current lease and writing
attempt while locked. It atomically sets the ready pointer and, only for an ended event,
sets replay status and records actor-less `automatic_replay` history. The existing
community lifecycle trigger writes its public cursor/event in that same transaction.
Rollback publishes none of those changes. Repeated completion creates no duplicate history.

Upload paths are allowlisted and attempt-specific. Generated files are validated for
nonempty regular files, checksums, aligned finite segment durations and complete VOD
playlists. Upload uses `If-None-Match: *`, followed by size/checksum-metadata verification
of every object. `ready.json` is written **last**, after a renewed lease/eligibility check.
The marker contains source/caption/manifest digests and aggregate file/byte counts, with
`reviewedCaptions: false` permitted. A marker alone never authorizes access: the application
requires a current database-ready pointer and current public authorization. A lost lease
or removal between marker write and completion leaves only an unreferenced prefix.

## Resource limits and shutdown

Library defaults are one job per encoder (hard maximum two), five-second polling,
60-second leases, 15-second heartbeats and a 30-minute whole-job deadline. A job accepts
at most 2 GiB of source, 7,200 seconds of media, 3840×2160 video and eight source audio
channels. It emits at most 4 GiB and 11,000 files; individual transport-stream segments
are limited to 4 MB. Fixed output bitrates/duration and a free-space preflight bound the
encoding budget. Use a worker volume with an enforced disk budget and enough headroom
for simultaneous input/output; admission is per worker process, not a global host quota.
Validate full-duration/4K resource use before increasing concurrency.

Source downloads stream to a private temporary directory, never buffer the recording in
RAM. FFmpeg uses two encoder/decoder threads and one filter thread, no shell/stdin, bounded
stdout, a local-file input protocol allowlist and disabled external MP4 data references.
See [FFmpeg protocol restrictions](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html). Source probing,
audio/video requirements, fixed output encoding and duration limits precede publication.

Shutdown aborts storage requests and encoder work, waits for child close (SIGTERM then
SIGKILL after two seconds), drains heartbeats and removes owned temporary files before
releasing upload protection. Configure the dedicated runtime pool with bounded acquisition
and query timeouts; the integration uses short timeouts to fit its eight-second graceful
encoder deadline and ten-second hard process deadline. Abrupt termination is recovered by
durable leases and cleanup, not an assumption that a shutdown handler always runs.

An abandoned attempt remains protected until its claim's whole-job deadline plus two
minutes, unless the worker has drained all I/O and explicitly releases protection. This
prevents deleting an old prefix while a paused writer may still be uploading. Cleanup
claims have their own fenced leases and bounded batches: at most 11,001 objects from that
exact attempt prefix, with no deletion of source MP4s, legacy manual packages or other
rooms. Partial deletion retries. Cancelled jobs are pruned after 30 days only once every
attempt has been cleaned. Ready and exhausted failed inputs remain retained while current.
Event/source retention must invalidate database eligibility before object deletion.

Fresh grants are refused as soon as the database input/visibility becomes ineligible.
Existing issued credentials retain their configured maximum access window; this queue
does not shorten a five-minute HLS capability or a one-hour legacy MP4 URL. Package cleanup
can remove abandoned or obsolete objects earlier, so recovery always requests fresh access.

## Repeatable evidence

Run with Node 24 from the repository root:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm run verify:media-packaging
node scripts/verify-replay-pipeline.js
```

The pipeline trial requires native PostgreSQL 17/18 tools (`initdb`, `pg_ctl`) and FFmpeg
on PATH. It refuses other Node/PostgreSQL major versions, creates a disposable localhost
cluster and random synthetic identities, runs actual migrations as owner, verifies the
separate runtime identity, then performs all queue/application work as runtime. It reads
no `.env`, accepts no hosted database URL and writes no provider or external bucket state.
The object adapter is synthetic in-memory storage, explicitly not proof of S3/R2 behavior.

The RSS sample interval is 30 ms and may miss a brief peak. Six-second timings/memory
are not capacity predictions for full recordings or provider-hosted workers. Unit tests
also cover bounded child execution, private-file cleanup, partial/corrupt/immutable upload,
marker ordering, missing/oversized sources, revoked leases and graceful cancellation.
Record the exact integration commit, deployed image, limits and platform during hosted
validation; these local results belong to the isolated packaging checkpoint.

## Rollout, rollback and diagnosis

Apply the additive migration before starting the integrated encoder. Leave packaging
disabled until the image, runtime identity, private bucket permissions, edge signature
checks and source completion reconciliation are available. Then use synthetic eligible
recordings to verify automatic readiness/publication, missing-caption behavior, optional
caption replacement, removal, source retention, provider webhook loss, crash/restart,
storage partial failure and cleanup on the actual deployed route. Inspect queue ages,
failure codes, active/expired leases and attempt cleanup backlog with runtime access.
Logs use fixed event names and bounded codes; they exclude source keys, private caption
text, object URLs, raw encoder stderr and credentials.

Pause/stop the encoder for rollback. Keep both tables/triggers and pending cleanup work;
the migration intentionally refuses a destructive down migration. The API can continue
to use eligible already-published packages, with the current authorization gate. Existing
MP4 fallback is degraded delivery and does not meet the adaptive acceptance requirement.
Never rewrite a ready prefix, delete queue tables while object cleanup is pending, or
restore a removed recording solely because a stale worker completed.

Release still requires actual storage/edge conditional-write and cache verification,
full-duration worker soak/crash trials, provider reconciliation evidence, and the
[playback envelope](media-playback-requirements.md), including provisional physical
iPhone SE (2nd generation)/Pixel 4a, browser cohorts, controlled recovery, capture-to-playback
delay and sustained media load. No current local check closes those gates or changes billing.
